# Blazor Application

This project creates a simple blazor app that includes an input ouput program as well as being to create a todo list and mark off completed items.

## Description

This project was created to gain a better understanding of using blazor. The code used was provided by the tutorial linked within the readme. The level of skill that I am at would be using visual studios and blazor to create a basic website with different features such as an todo list, an input and output page. This was created for an assigment in COP 3003. The is administered at Florida Gulf Coast University.
